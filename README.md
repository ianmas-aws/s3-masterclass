Code Samples and Documentation from the AWS S3 Masterclass Webinar

Python Samples
--------------
Python samples require that you have installed and configured the AWS Python SDK - boto

You can find boto on GitHub - http://github.com/boto/boto and you can find full getting started instructions at the AWS SDK for Python (Boto) page here http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforpython/ on the AWS website

There are three Python code samples:

* CreateExpiringLink - creates time-limited signed URLs for objects stored in AWS S3
* ListObjectVersions - lists prior versions of objects retained when object versioning is enabled
* PrintSetKeyMetadata - prints or sets user defined metadata for an object stored in AWS S3 

Contributions/To Do
-------------------

I am always looking for contibutors that might like to translate these code samples into order languages using the other AWS SDKs so if that's you, please go right ahead and send me a pull request
